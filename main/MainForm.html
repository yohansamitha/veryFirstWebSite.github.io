<h3>CSS Layout Float</h3>
<p>In this example, we have created a header, two columns/boxes and a footer.
    On smaller screens, the columns will stack on top of each other.</p>
<p>Resize the browser window to see the responsive effect (you will learn more about this in our next chapter - HTML
    Responsive.)</p>

<header>
    <h1>Cities</h1>

<section>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">London</a></li>

        <h1>London</h1>
        <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a
            metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
        <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to
            its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>

<p>Once you understand the fundamentals of HTML, we recommend that you learn further HTML and CSS at the same time,
    moving back and forth between the two topics. This is because HTML is far more interesting and much more fun to
    learn when you apply CSS, and you can't really learn CSS without knowing HTML.</p>

<aside>
    You should learn the basics of HTML before attempting any CSS. We recommend that you work through our
    Introduction to HTML module first.

<p>Before starting this topic, you should also be familiar with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just
    looking at it, consuming the content). You should have a basic work environment set up as detailed in Installing
    basic software and understand how to create and manage files, as detailed in Dealing with files â€” both of which are
    parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.</p>

<p>It is also recommended that you work through Getting started with the web before proceeding with this topic,
    especially if you are completely new to web development. However, much of what is covered in its CSS basics article
    is also covered in our CSS first steps module, albeit in a lot more detail.</p>
